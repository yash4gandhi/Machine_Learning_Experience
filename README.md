# My experience in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing:

Research Experience:<br>
Unsupervised WhatsApp Fake News Detection Using Semantic Search: https://github.com/yash4gandhi/Unsupervised-WhatsApp-fake-news-detection-using-semantic-search : I worked on determining the authenticity of messages forwarded on WhatsApp messenger using a semantic search based approach by applying BERT transfer learning model.
<br><br>
Apart from that I have taken the following academic courses to learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning:
