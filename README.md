# My experience in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing:

## Research Assistant | University of Southern California June 2023 – Present<br>
• Enhanced the accuracy of oil production estimates at petroleum wells from 30% to 78% by leveraging advanced generative 
AI models, including TimeGrad and Informer, for precise forecasting of long-sequence multi-well production data.<br> 
• Improved CFD simulations using Fourier Neural Operators and experimental field data to accurately forecast methane 
emissions from structurally compromised oil wells, ensuring safety and supporting greenhouse gas reduction targets. <br>
• Collaborated with the Ershaghi Center for Energy Transition (ECET) to develop AI models for analyzing noisy, irregular time 
series from airborne spectrometers, improving the accuracy of global methane emission mapping. <br>
• Streamlined real-time denoising of electron microscope images with AWS pipeline integrated to web interface for analysis. 
• Reduced workflow overhead by 40%, enabling researchers at Sandia National Lab to upload, analyze and visualize images. <br>
• Employed unsupervised DnCNN, to denoise in-situ TEM data, improving signal-to-noise ratio by 36% for enhanced structural 
analysis of iron-oxide transformation.  <br>
• Employed Gen AI - Diffusion to generate protein peptide sequences for Cancer research, attaining 88% accuracy in 
experimental validation and significantly accelerating cancer therapeutic research timelines. <br>

## Research Assistant | Sardar Patel Institute of Technology Jan 2020 - May 2020<br>
Unsupervised WhatsApp Fake News Detection Using Semantic Search<br>
• Proposed and implemented a solution to determine the authenticity of messages forwarded on WhatsApp Messenger. <br>
• Devised a semantic search-based approach using BERT transfer learning model to determine the veracity of the claims <br>
stated in the messages with an accuracy of 78.09% by using cosine similarity with corresponding authentic news sources.<br>
• Performed web-scraping using selenium web-driver to create training and testing database
