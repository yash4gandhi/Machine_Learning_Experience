# My experience in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing:

Research Assistant | University of Southern California June 2023 – Present<br>
• Performed Deep Generative Modeling of physical vapor deposition (PVD) dataset for Sandia National Lab.<br>
• Used Denoising Diffusion probabilistic and Implicit models (DDPM, DDIM) on the PVD data.<br>
• Embedded the deep generative model in offline reinforcement learning to create thin film synthesis structures.<br>
<br><br>
Research Assistant | Sardar Patel Institute of Technology Jan 2020 - May 2020<br>
Unsupervised WhatsApp Fake News Detection Using Semantic Search<br>
• Proposed and implemented a solution to determine the authenticity of messages forwarded on WhatsApp Messenger. <br>
• Devised a semantic search-based approach using BERT transfer learning model to determine the veracity of the claims <br>
stated in the messages with an accuracy of 78.09% by using cosine similarity with corresponding authentic news sources.<br>
• Performed web-scraping using selenium web-driver to create training and testing database
<br
